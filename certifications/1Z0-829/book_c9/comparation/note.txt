When to Use Each:
Use Comparable when the comparison logic is standard for a specific class and you want a 
single natural sorting order.
Use Comparator when you need more flexibility in defining different sorting orders for objects, 
especially when dealing with third-party classes or when multiple sorting sequences are required.
